Adapting to change is becoming increasingly important in the workplace, as organizations must remain flexible and adaptable to remain competitive. Leaders must be willing to embrace change and pivot strategies and initiatives as needed to stay ahead of the curve.

Furthermore, leaders must provide the necessary resources and support to help employees adapt to new changes and challenges.
